            <li>2 pounds pork sausage</li>
            <li>4 cups dried breaad crumbs, seasoned</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place eggs in saucepan and cover with water. Bring to boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs sit in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel.</li>
